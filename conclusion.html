      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Certainly, there are no right answers to the question of which layout or color method is more appropriate—which is why data visualizations are as rhetorical as they are quantitative. The more ambiguous a visualization, the more it tends toward the rhetorical end of the spectrum, and the more precise the more it tends toward the quantitative. It would be a mistake, however, to suggest that more precise visualizations are not at all rhetorical. Darrell Huff and Irving Geis in <em>How to Lie with Statistics</em>, respond to this problem:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>This suggests giving statistical material […] a very sharp second look before accepting any of them. Sometimes a careful squint will sharpen the focus. But arbitrarily rejecting statistical methods makes no sense either. That is like refusing to read because writers sometimes use words to hide facts and relationships rather than to reveal them (121).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In moving beyond the fact/decption binary for information rhetorics, the more difficult issue raised by the relationship of rhetoric to statistical reasoning is which choices—among a variety of reasonable non-deceptive choices for data visulizations—best represent the underlying data? As more and more types of data visualizations are made available, answers to questions like this will venture further away from purely quantitative answers.</p>
      <!--Finally, -->
      <!--In many ways this is a new variation on the concern of Jahne Fanestock regarding Rhetoric and Science. XXXTurn to discuss the rhetoric of science and Fhaenstock's quote about feedback between science and rhetoric. -->
      <!--Jeanne Fahnestock has tried to put pressure on the idea that science and rhetoric are mutually exclusive territories; “the terms on both sides of the preposition in the phrase 'rhetoric of science' come out somewhat changed. A rhetoric of science puts pressure on both science and rhetoric” (278). Fahnestock's impressive work, such as her Rhetorical Figures in Science, understands the rhetoric of science as using sylistics, figures, tropes, and schemes to read and rewrite the persuasive elements of scientific inquiry/writing. Although she has called for a more integrated convergence of rhetoric and science, so far this convergence has been relatively limited to the “formal possibilities, identified ultimately in both rhetoric and neurolinguistics, and [how] the historical particulars together constitute the ‘available means of persuasion'” (175). -->
