##Conclusion
<!--Finally, -->

<!--In many ways this is a new variation on the concern of Jahne Fanestock regarding Rhetoric and Science. XXXTurn to discuss the rhetoric of science and Fhaenstock's quote about feedback between science and rhetoric. -->

<!--Jeanne Fahnestock has tried to put pressure on the idea that science and rhetoric are mutually exclusive territories; “the terms on both sides of the preposition in the phrase 'rhetoric of science' come out somewhat changed. A rhetoric of science puts pressure on both science and rhetoric” (278). Fahnestock's impressive work, such as her Rhetorical Figures in Science, understands the rhetoric of science as using sylistics, figures, tropes, and schemes to read and rewrite the persuasive elements of scientific inquiry/writing. Although she has called for a more integrated convergence of rhetoric and science, so far this convergence has been relatively limited to the “formal possibilities, identified ultimately in both rhetoric and neurolinguistics, and [how] the historical particulars together constitute the ‘available means of persuasion'” (175). -->
