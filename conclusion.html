      <blockquote>
      <p>This suggests giving statistical material…a very sharp second look before accepting any of them. Sometimes a careful squint will sharpen the focus. But arbitrarily rejecting statistical methods makes no sense either. That is like refusing to read because writers sometimes use words to hide facts and relationships rather than to reveal them (121). <strong>Darrell Huff and Irving Geis in “How to Lie with Statistics.”</strong></p>

      <p>Certainly, for many exploratory data analyses, there are no “right” answers to the questions of which layout or color method is more appropriate—which is another reason why data visualizations are as rhetorical as they are quantitative. I provided arguments for why various methods and options made sense given the assumptions of what word clouds are intended to portray, but as with any rhetorical artifact (statistical or otherwise), these choices depend just as much on audience, delivery, and the broader rhetorical situation as they do on the underlying data and project goals. In moving beyond the fact/decption binary for information rhetorics, the more difficult issue raised by the relationship of rhetoric to statistical reasoning is which choices—among an increasing variety of reasonably non-deceptive choices for data visulization—most effectively represent the underlying data? As more and more types of data visualizations are made available, answers to questions like these will continue to venture further away from purely quantitative answers.</p>
      <p>While this article focuses on data literacy and statistical reasoning more broadly conceived, these questions are becoming directly relevant to the actual methods and research conducted within digital rhetoric and writing studies. Significant progress has been made in the digital humanities to implement these methods for the computational reading of literary corpora, but much work remains to bring similar tools and methods into writing studies and digital rhetoric. As Bill Hart-Davidson and Jim Ridolfo argue in the introduction to <em>Rhetoric and the Digital Humanities</em>, the digital humanities and rhetoric have many shared interests and overlapping concerns (cite). In my forthcoming chapter for <em>Writing, Rhetoric, and Circulation Studies</em>, I argue for developing applications of text mining and natural language processing tools to study how multimodal writing and digital artifacts circulate among social networks. This webtext provides a basic introduction to these tools, but text mining and natural language processing are scalable to many broad and diverse applications for digital rhetoric and writing studies.</p>
      <p>In a recent publication for <em>Enculturation</em>, Eric Detweiler conducts an empirical analysis of the relationship between the terms “rhetoric” and “composition.” By mining the text from works cited lists from <em>College Composition and Communication</em> and <em>Rhetoric Society Quarterly</em>, Detweiler examines the pairing of these terms and their tentative relationship as portrayed in citation data. Responding to the work of Derrick N. Mueller mentioned in the introduction of this webtext, Detweiler’s research provides a “picture of the most influential citees, journals, and key terms—as well as the trajectories of these influences over the past decade.” Other projects, such as Jim Ridolfo’s <a href="http://rhetmap.org/">Rhetmap.org</a> use <em>Modern Language Association</em> Jobs Information List data to map trends in rhetoric and composition hiring practices. Research that helps scholars understand trends in the field will continue to have a reciprocal feedback affect on the types of research that are prioritized in the future. An improved focus on data literacy will help scholars contribute to this important work, as well as providing the necessary skills and awareness to be critical of its effects.</p>
      <p>In many ways, the renewed interest in empirical studies, data-intensive research, and information rhetorics is a new variation on Jahne Fanestock’s work with the rhetoric of science. Jeanne Fahnestock worked to complicate the idea that science and rhetoric are mutually exclusive territories: “the terms on both sides of the preposition in the phrase ‘rhetoric of science’ come out somewhat changed. A rhetoric of science puts pressure on both science and rhetoric” (278). Fahnestock’s <em>Rhetorical Figures in Science</em>, understands the rhetoric of science as using sylistics, figures, tropes, and schemes to read and rewrite the persuasive elements of scientific inquiry and writing. Although she has called for a more integrated convergence of rhetoric and science, until recently the convergence has been relatively limited to the “formal possibilities, identified ultimately in both rhetoric and neurolinguistics, and [how] the historical particulars together constitute the ‘available means of persuasion’” (175).</p>
