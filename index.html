      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>As digital rhetoric and visual design studies turn their attention to data visualization and infographic media, much work remains to understand quantitative reasoning and statistical analysis as rhetorical constructions. In “Rhetorical Numbers: A Case for Quantitative Writing in the Composition Classroom,” Joanna Wolfe argues that rhetorical approaches to quantitative reasoning remain largely overlooked in writing studies classrooms. As Wolfe explains, “Rather than reject quantitative argument out of hand, contemporary rhetoricians need to train their students to recognize the unethical, deceptive, and misleading as well as thoughtful, instightful, and revealing applications of quantitative rhetoric” (454). Beyond the concerns of the writing classroom, data literacy is quickly becoming a crucial component of public discourse and digital rhetoric on a broader scale. Since 2012, the White House has been following through with President Obama’s “Big Data Initiative” which attempts to provide “consumers with the full landscape of information they need to make optimal energy decisions; to enabling civil engineers to monitor and identify at-risk infrastructure; to informing more accurate predictions of natural disasters; […] to advance national goals such as economic growth, education, health, and clean energy” (cite). As more and more of traditional “analyses” are replaced with data “analytics”[^1], critically aware citizens must be provided with access to underlying datasets on which analytics are built, and with the statistical methods used to process, analyze, and visualize the data. However, an improved access to data and a greater transparency among analytics is meaningless if the available means of statistcal analylsis are not understood as inventive, persuasive forms of argumentation.</p>
      <p>This article provides examples for how the <em>choices</em> made during data processing and statistical analysis effect the visualizations those analyses produce. The use of the term <em>choice</em> here suggests more variablility and indeterminacy than what is often implied by the concept of statistical reasoning, but the range of possibilities—the notion that data analysis is inventive and experimental—is an largely unexplored analogue between rhetoric and statistics. Often, when rhetoric and statistics are compared, it is the supposed “deceptive” nature of statistical “facts” that are discussed. Although the origin of the quote remains uncertain, Mark Twain is credited for popularizing the phrase: “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.” This deceptive understanding of statistics is similar to the way rhetoric is often described in journalism or politics—usually indicating a particular stylistics that appears overtly persuasive. Yet, in stark contrast, visualized statistical analyses often appear in jounalism, entertainment media, and politics as impenetrable and unquestionable form of evidence. As Wolfe explains, “there is a paradox in that on one hand our culture tends to represent statistical evidence as a type of ‘fact’ and therefore immune to the arts of rhetoric, but on the other hand we are deeply aware and suspicious of the ability of statistics to be ‘cooked,’ ‘massaged,’ ‘spun,’ or otherwise manipulated” (453).</p>
      <p>While Wolfe uses the phrase “quantitative rhetoric,” I prefer to use the broader concept of “statistical reasoning” because this allows for both quantitative and qualitative forms of data and information. Both rhetoric and statistics provide wide-ranging methods of analysis and knowledge-construction that may be applied to an endless array of topics and content for research. Because of this commonality, the two are active in many (if not all) disciplines in the academy. While many forms of rhetoric are associated with qualitative research, and statistics with quantitative research, they frequently cross over these boundaries. For example, ethnographic research relies on discourse analysis in order to carefully construct case studies about situated variations of cultural rhetorics and artifacts. However, if enough individual cases are reconstructed and categorized, then these cases may be counted and compared quantitatively. As a counter example, statistical tools may be used to test a hypothesis against a particular dataset, and then rhetoric is utilized when researchers interpret and communicate their results. While these two examples draw a traditional line between rhetoric and statistics, in the areas of data literacy and information design no easy distinction exists. Data visualization and descriptive statistics are applicable to both quantitative and qualitative research.</p>
      <p>In order to move beyond a simplistic truth/lie binary of statistical reasoning, the inventive aspects of statistcal analysis require closer examination. As Wolfe argues, “students should have practice making their own arguments from quantitative data […] so they can see the role invention plays” (455). In the tradition of statistical analysis, this inventive practice is called “exploratory” statistics. As John W. Tukey notes in his now canonical text <em>Exploratory Data Analysis</em>, “many of the indications to be discerned in bodies of data are accidental or misleading. […] To fail to collect all appearances because some—or even most—are only accidents would, however, be gross misfeasance.” Yet, as Tukey explains, exploratory data analysis “can never be the whole story, but nothing else can serve as the foundation stone—as the first step” (3). XXXRestate, summarize exporatory research, transitionXXX</p>
      <p>XXXThis needs to be its own paragraph with examplesXXX The problem with observing this first exploratory step is that many of the cloud data visualization tools available online have already worked through the exploratory aspects of their analyses—much like reading the polished final draft of an essay. Just as new writers have to understand that mistake-filled first drafts are a common aspect of writing, data literacy requires an understanding of the common exploratory methods that lead to polished infographics and effective data analytics. XXXThis is where the “sweeping it under the rug” can really come to lifeXXX.</p>
      <p>XXXUse the source LG gave you to revise this paragraph. Provide other positive examples of WCs in use, and revise this paragraph to be positiveXXX Wordcloud or tagcloud data visualizations exemplify this problem. Wordclouds may be some-what out of fashion for visualizing textual analysis. Or, maybe wordclouds are so common that they are no longer thought of as a useful form of data visualization—especially as more complex analytics have become readily available. However, their ubiquity is precisely why they are useful for the demonstration that follows. A useful comparison for wordclouds is understanding them as similar to a cliche idomatic expression—seeing a wordcloud is like hearing “it’s raining cats and dogs.” The individual words that make up the idiom, or the etymology that led to its frequent use, are often not considered in the passing of a conversation. Likewise, with wordclouds, there are many steps that occur between the raw unstructured text and the final wordcloud visualization. Some of the steps require data scrubbing or data janitorial work, others involve making quantitative choices with how text data is organized and represented, and finally, choices are made regarding how the colors are programmatically asigned to quantitative categories of words.</p>
      <p>When a wordcloud tool like Wordle.net is used, many of the data janitorial steps that process the text are hidden in the underlying computer code that turns the raw text into a wordcloud visualization. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with using cloud tools to produce a data visualization. Indeed, many of the cloud tools provide an accessible way for students and scholars to begin investigating the visual aspects of data analysis. As with any form of analysis, the danger of such tools is their standardization and overused application. Often they require a specific data type, one that is cleaned and processed according to an already well-tested methodology that produces a polished data visualization. In many ways this is similar to the limitations of the 5 paragraph essay. XXXCite LG and CGB hereXXX. While there is nothing inherently wrong with the 5 paragraph essay (this article, in fact, uses a 5 section theme that is analogous to the 5 paragraph essay—as do many academic articles), the risk of any ubiquitous form or methodology is that it is applied to too wide a range of objects and thus loses its descriptive and analytical effectiveness. In many respects, this has happened to the wordcloud visualization. Thus, revealing the exploratory aspects of this common tool will provide a pragmatic introduction to the inventive aspects of statistical reasoning and its relenace for data literacy and information rhetorics.</p>
